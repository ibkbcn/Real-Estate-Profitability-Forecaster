## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to analyze real estate profitability. 

The core objective is to calculate the **Break-Even Point (BEP)** for potential investments by combining the outputs of two distinct predictive models:

* **Purchase Price Predictor:** Estimates the fair market buy price based on property features.
* **Rental Price Predictor:** Estimates the potential monthly rental income.

By integrating these predictions, the system approximates the time required to recover the initial investment.

## Dataset

**Source:** Barcelona Real Estate Market Sample

**Context:** The project utilizes two distinct datasets to train the respective regression models independently. These datasets represent a snapshot of the Barcelona real estate market.

| Dataset | Sample Size | Target Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sale Flats** | 5,847 rows | `Purchase Price` (€) | Training data for property valuation features. |
| **Rent Flats** | 8,502 rows | `Monthly Rent` (€) | Training data for estimating potential rental income. |

## Methodology

To ensure robust predictions and minimize overfitting, several strategic decisions were made **throughout the development pipeline**:

### 1. Preprocessing & Outlier Detection
* **Luxury Filter:** Applied statistical filtering to remove extreme outliers (e.g., luxury properties) that could skew the model for standard investment analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **Correlation Analysis:** Identified key drivers of price fluctuation.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce noise and collinearity.
* **Statistical Testing:** Used **ANOVA** to understand the variance impact of categorical features.
* **Explainability:** Integrated **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret feature importance globally and locally.

### 3. Modeling Strategy
We employed a variety of regression techniques to maximize accuracy:
* **Bagging Regressors**
* **Random Forest**
* **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

## Model Evaluation

To rigorously evaluate the performance of our models, we utilized the following metrics:

* **R² (Coefficient of Determination):**
    * *Significance:* Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Price) that is predictable from the independent variables (Features). A higher score implies a better fit.
* **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):**
    * *Significance:* Measures the average magnitude of the errors in Euros. Unlike MAE, RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily, which is crucial in financial forecasting where large deviations carry higher risk.

### Results

We evaluated multiple regression algorithms to identify the best performer. The tables below summarize the performance on the **Test Set**.

### Purchase Price Prediction
*Target: Total Sale Price (€)*

| Model | R² Score | RMSE (€) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bagging Regressor** | 0.016 | 26,678 | ❌ Discarded |
| **Random Forest** | 0.045 | 24,049 | ❌ Discarded |
| **XGBoost** | **0.443** | **17,556** | ✅ **Selected** |

> **Insight:** The purchase market shows higher variance and is likely influenced by external macroeconomic factors not present in the dataset. Specifically, **an R² of 0.443 implies that our model successfully captures nearly 45% of the price variability based solely on physical attributes**, while the remaining variance is likely driven by subjective human factors (e.g., renovation quality, seller urgency) or unobserved micro-location trends.

### Rental Price Prediction
*Target: Monthly Rent (€)*

| Model | R² Score | RMSE (€) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XGBoost** | **0.809** | **413** | ✅ **Selected** |

> **Conclusion:** The rental model achieves high accuracy (R² > 0.80), indicating that monthly income is strongly correlated with structural features (location, size, amenities).

## Limitations

While the model performs robustly based on structural features, it is subject to the following constraints due to the nature of the data:

* **Lack of Temporal Granularity (Seasonality):** The dataset represents a static snapshot of the market. Consequently, the model cannot account for seasonal fluctuations in rental prices (e.g., peak season spikes in coastal areas or start-of-term demand in university districts). The predictions reflect an average baseline market value rather than a time-specific dynamic price.

## Future Improvements

To enhance the project's complexity and deployment readiness, future iterations will include:

* **Ensemble Learning:** Implementing **Stacking** strategies to combine the strengths of multiple base estimators.
* **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** developing specialized sub-models for specific property types (e.g., Penthouses vs. Studios).
* **API Integration:** Wrapping the model in a FastAPI container to serve real-time predictions.
